# PathFinding Visualizer
## Algorithms Implemented
- Breadth First Search(BFS): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
- Dijkstra's Algorithm:  the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
- A* Algorithm: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Jump Point Search Algorithm:  an optimization to the A* search algorithm for uniform-cost grids
## Instructions to Run
- Clone the repository and run the index.html file.
- Choose the starting, ending nodes and path blockages and select the algorithm which you want to run.
- Analyze the running time of Algorithm on the top right corner of your screen.
